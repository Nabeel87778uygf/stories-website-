            Once, there was a slave named Androcles who ran away from his mean master. He hid in a forest and found a cave to rest in. Suddenly, he heard a loud roar and saw a big lion coming towards him. Androcles was scared, but then he noticed the lion was limping and in pain.
Androcles saw a thorn stuck in the lion's paw. Even though he was afraid, he decided to help. He gently pulled out the thorn. The lion was very grateful and licked Androcles' hand before walking away.
Later, Androcles was caught and taken back to the city. He was thrown into a big arena with a hungry lion as punishment. When the lion saw Androcles, it didn't attack. Instead, it recognized him and licked his hands. It was the same lion he had helped!
The people watching were amazed. They told the emperor, who decided to set Androcles free because he had been kind. Androcles and the lion became friends and stayed together.
