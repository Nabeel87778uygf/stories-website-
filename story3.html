            <h5 class="card-title"> The Ant and the Grasshopper</h1>
        <p class="mt-3"> Once upon a time, in a lush green meadow, there lived an industrious ant and a carefree grasshopper. All summer long, the ant worked hard, gathering food and storing it in his nest for the winter. He toiled day and night, carrying heavy loads and preparing for the cold months ahead.
            Meanwhile, the grasshopper spent his summer singing, dancing, and enjoying the warm sunshine. He mocked the ant for working so hard and said, "Why do you waste your time gathering food? There's plenty to eat now, and the weather is perfect for having fun!"
            The ant replied, "I'm preparing for the winter. When the cold comes, there won't be any food left, and I want to be ready."
            The grasshopper laughed and continued his carefree ways, hopping from flower to flower and playing his fiddle.
            As the seasons changed, autumn arrived, and soon after, winter set in. The meadow was covered in a thick blanket of snow, and food became scarce. The grasshopper, who had spent the summer enjoying himself, found himself hungry and shivering in the cold.
            Desperate, the grasshopper went to the ant's nest and begged for food. "Please, Ant, can you spare some food? I'm starving and cold."
            The ant, though sympathetic, said, "I worked hard all summer to gather and store this food. What were you doing when I was working?"</p>
             <h2>Moral of the story</h2>
             <p>This story teaches the importance of hard work, planning, and preparing for the future.</p>
