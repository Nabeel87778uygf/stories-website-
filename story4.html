        <p class="mt-3"> 
            Once upon a time, in a lush, green jungle, there lived a mighty elephant named Elmer. Elmer was very proud of his size and strength, and he often bullied the smaller animals of the jungle.
One hot day, Elmer was walking through the jungle when he came across a small hill. He stomped on the hill with his big, heavy foot, destroying it completely. Little did he know, this hill was the home of a colony of ants. The ants were terrified and angry at the destruction of their home.
The leader of the ants, a wise old ant named Antonia, decided to teach the arrogant elephant a lesson. She gathered all the ants and together, they came up with a plan. The next morning, when Elmer was sleeping under a big tree, the ants quietly crawled up his trunk and into his ears.
Suddenly, Elmer woke up with a start. He could feel the tiny ants crawling all over him, inside his ears, and even up his trunk. He shook his head and flapped his ears, but the ants held on tight. Elmer trumpeted in pain and ran through the jungle, trying to shake off the ants.
“Stop! Stop! Please, I’m sorry!” Elmer cried out.
Hearing his plea, Antonia signaled the ants to stop and they all climbed down from Elmer. The elephant, now humbled, looked at Antonia and said, “I’m sorry for destroying your home. I realize now that even the smallest creatures can be powerful. I promise to never harm you or any other small animals again.”
Antonia nodded and said, “We forgive you, Elmer. Remember, strength isn’t about size; it’s about respect and kindness.”
From that day on, Elmer became friends with the ants and all the other animals in the jungle. He learned to use his strength to help others rather than harm them, and he lived happily and peacefully among his new friends.

             <h2>Moral of the story</h2>
             <p>Respect all creatures, big or small, for everyone has their own unique strengths..</p>
