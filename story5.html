        <p class="mt-3"> 
            Once upon a time, on a sunny summer day, a mother duck sat on her nest, waiting for her eggs to hatch. She had five beautiful eggs and one odd, large egg that was different from the rest. One by one, the eggs began to hatch, and out came five fluffy, yellow ducklings. Finally, the large egg cracked open, and out came a big, grey, awkward-looking bird.
The other ducklings were curious about their unusual sibling. "He's so ugly!" they whispered. The mother duck was surprised too but loved all her ducklings just the same. She decided to take them all to the pond to teach them how to swim.
At the pond, the ugly duckling struggled more than his siblings. The other animals mocked him, saying, "What an ugly duckling! He doesn't belong here." Even his siblings teased him and left him out of their games. Feeling lonely and sad, the ugly duckling decided to run away.
He wandered through the countryside, facing harsh weather and many dangers. The poor duckling tried to find a place where he could belong, but everywhere he went, he was met with cruelty and rejection. Winter arrived, and the ugly duckling had to endure the cold and hunger all alone.
One day, exhausted and nearly frozen, he found shelter in a barn. The kind farmer who owned the barn took pity on him and brought him inside to warm up. But the ugly duckling knew he couldn't stay there forever and, once he was strong enough, he left the barn and continued his journey.
As spring approached, the ugly duckling noticed the world coming back to life. Flowers bloomed, and birds sang in the trees. One day, he saw a group of majestic swans swimming gracefully in a pond. He was drawn to their beauty and elegance but felt too ashamed to approach them.
Suddenly, the swans noticed him and swam over. To his surprise, they didn't mock him or chase him away. Instead, they welcomed him warmly. The ugly duckling looked down at his reflection in the water and was astonished to see that he had transformed into a beautiful swan!
Realizing that he had never been an ugly duckling but a swan all along, he joined his new friends, finally finding a place where he belonged. He spread his wings and soared into the sky, feeling pure joy and freedom.
The other animals who once mocked him were amazed at his transformation. They now admired and respected the beautiful swan. The once-ugly duckling had found his true self and lived happily ever after.

             <h2>Moral of the story</h2>
             <p>Don't judge yourself or others based on appearances. True beauty and worth come from within, and everyone has their own unique journey to discover their potential.</p>
