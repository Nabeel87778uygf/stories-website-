        <p class="mt-3">
            Once upon a time, there was a dog who was very hungry. He wandered through the streets, searching for food. After a while, he found a big, juicy bone lying on the ground. The dog was thrilled. He quickly grabbed the bone in his mouth and decided to take it home where he could enjoy it in peace.
On his way home, the dog had to cross a small wooden bridge over a stream. As he was walking across the bridge, he looked down and saw his own reflection in the water below. The dog, however, did not realize it was his own reflection; he thought it was another dog with a bone that looked even bigger and juicier 
than the one he had.
Greedy and wanting the other bone as well, the dog barked at his reflection. But as he opened his mouth to bark, the bone he was holding fell out and dropped into the stream. The dog tried to retrieve it, but it was too late. The bone sank to the bottom, and the stream carried it away.
The dog stood there sadly, realizing that in his greed to get the other bone, he had lost the one he already had. He walked home empty-handed, learning a valuable lesson: "It's better to be content with what you have than to lose it by being greedy."
